# PASS3 ID Connect Introduction

PASS3 ID Connect is a developer product for anyone who wish to
integrate with PASS3 Identity ecosystem.

There are two approaches for integrating with PASS3 Identity
ecosystem:

- If you are not ready to fully embrace the self-sovereign identity,
  we offer the [PASS3 ID Login](pass3-login). It provides familiar experiences of
  OAuth 2.0.
- For those who are ready to deal with self-sovereign identity
  directly, we offer the [PASS3 ID with OpenID4VP](pass3-openid4vp-quick-integration).
